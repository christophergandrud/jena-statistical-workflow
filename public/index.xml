      <description>Workflow of Statistical Data Analysis Instructor: Christopher Gandrud, PhD
Email: christopher.gandrud@gmail.com
About In this workshop you will learn an end-to-end and &amp;ldquo;really reproducible&amp;rdquo; workflow for statistical data analysis. The workflow is centred on the R programming language. First you will learn the basic concepts of programming for statistical analysis and how these concepts are represented in R. Then you will learn how to structure your statistical projects from data gathering through data transformation and analysis to the presentation of results in automatically generated tables papers and slideshows in a way that is really reproducible.</description>
