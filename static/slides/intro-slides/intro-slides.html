# Is this research?

---

# Is this research?

![](img/cox.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# No

&gt; Papers, articles, slideshows, talks, books are **advertising, not research**.

---

# What are journal articles/books/etc?

&gt; **Presentation documents**: announce select findings and try to convince an
audience that they are correct.

---

# What is research?

Quantitative research involves the **procedures** and **choices** researchers make to **gather** data, **process** it, and **analysis** it in order to address their research questions.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

This includes ‚Äúthe **full software environment**, **code**, and **data** that produced the results‚Äù (Donoho 2010, 3015).

---

# Quants and computer programming

&gt; The practice of quantitative science **is computer programming**.

&lt;br&gt;

So, we need **computer programming tools** (preview: literate programming).

---

# Reproducible Comp. Research

---

# Replicable

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

**Replicable research**: when there is sufficient information available for independent researchers to make the **same findings**, using the **same procedures** with ***new*** data.

---

# However . . .

Sometimes full replications are not feasible because:

- **limited resources** for gathering new data (e.g. very expensive to build
another Large Hadron Collider),

- the original research already sampled the **universe of cases**.

*So...*

---

# Reproducible

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

**Reproducible research**: when there is **sufficient information** available for independent researchers to make the same findings, using the same procedures with the **same data**.

---

# Sufficient info.?--unconnected files

![](img/non_linked_workflow/unconnected_workflow.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Sufficient info.?--dynamically linked files

![](img/linked_workflow/rep_workflow.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Linking with literate programming 

Quantitative data science is the **creation of a computer programme** to gather, transform, analyse data and present the results.

&lt;br&gt;

**Literate programming paradigm**: the human-readable presentation of a programme is interspersed with computer source code that are compiled together (see Knuth1992).

---

# Toolbox

- **Machine-readable source code**: R (alternatives: Python, Julia, etc.)

- **Human-readable explanation**: a markup language like Markdown
(alternatives: `\(\LaTeX\)`, HTML, etc.)

- "**Knit**" together with R Markdown.

    + R Markdown allows us to use one markup language--Markdown--to output to different presentation document types (e.g. PDF, HTML, MS Word).

    + Conversion from R Markdown to these formats is done via [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)

- **[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)** are a major alternative used frequently in industry.

    + Also use Markdown and "knit/weave" results together and can be used with R and Python.

# Why reproducible research? 

There are **costs** to using these tools. You have to learn how to program.

So, **why** do it?

---

# Scientific standard

Reproducibility is a **minimum** standard for evaluating scientific claims.

---

# Mistakes

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Reproducibility can help uncover research fabrication. But more commonly . . .

&lt;br&gt;

We **all make mistakes** during all stages of our research!

---

# A mistake 

I wanted to merge fisal policy data from two data sets using country IDs.

![](img/codes.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# A mistake

But, Eurostat uses slightly different country IDs.

![](img/mismatched_codes.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Correcting the mistake

Fortunately, I had documented all of my steps using literate programming and could quickly find and fix the problem.

![](img/matched_codes.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Correcting mistakes

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

**Instead of pretending** like mistakes don‚Äôt happen, we should have **procedures that help us minimise** our errors and allow us (and others) to **find and correct** the errors we do make.

&lt;br&gt;

Really reproducible research is an important part of this process.

Including automated **tests** in reproducible research docs also helps find mistakes fast.

---

# Important Caveat!

&gt; "A study can be reproducible and still be wrong" (Peng 2014).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The original finding could just have been noise or caused by some data processing error and so on.

# In your research . . .

---

# ü§î In your research:

- do you plan to uphold **core scientific standards** (hopefully this goes without saying)?

- do you plan to **repeat** the task?

- do you want others (or yourself in the future( to be able to **replicate** your data collection process?

- does the data task have **non-trivial** scope and complexity?

# . . . ‚òùÔ∏è then a reproducible statistical workflow is for you.

# Work Execution

In quantitative methods courses, we usually learn about **work execution**. For example, 

- transforming a data set to make it useable by a model

- applying a statistical procedure to a data set

- reasoning about the results of a statistical procedure

---

# Workflow

But having an effective **workflow** is critical. A workflow is:

&gt; the process by which work is selected and **organised** for execution.

This course does not cover how you select projects and prioritise avenues of investigation, though this is crucial for a project's success.

**Tools for automating research execution**

This course does cover the programmatic tools for automating quantitative research organisationa and execution.

# Programmatic

&gt; a task done through computer program **code**. It is repeatable and not manual.

# Ideally our programs are **extensible**

&gt; designed to be used not just with data we have seen, but also new data.

Our workflow should be **extensible** as well to many different statistical research projects.

Programmatic and reproducible statistical research workflows are valuable for extensibility

# üéì Academic

- Skills needed to do **original quantitative research** for your **research**.

- State-of-the-art tools needed for **future high-level academic research**.

    + Take advantage of new data sources

    + Avoid effort duplication

    + Make your research reproducible

---

# üè≠ Industry 

Automated data collection and retrieval **scales**.

We don't just want to solve a customer problem once, we want to solve it many times with the **marginal cost decreasing** each additional time we solve the problem.

# üè≠ Industry 

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&gt; "It's not interesting if it doesn't scale." -- Jim Freeman

---

# üè≠ Industry 

So, being able to scale data science--automate data retrieval and management--is highly valued. E.g. on [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/research/DE/Job=Data_Scientist/Salary):

# Practical tips for reproducible research

- ‚úèÔ∏è Document Everything!

- üìÑ Everything is a (text) file.

- ü§ì All files should be human readable.

- ‚ãà Explicitly tie your files together.

- üóÇ Have a plan to organise, store, and make your files available.

# Important Sidenote: Personal data privacy

background-color: #000000

# üèõ Ethical data retrieval and management

&gt; Privacy and data protection are fundamental rights, which need to be protected. ([EUI 2019](https://www.eui.eu/Documents/ServicesAdmin/DeanOfStudies/ResearchEthics/Guide-Data-Protection-Research.pdf))

---

# Always. . .

Consider the needs for privacy and protecting persons' data.

‚ö†Ô∏è It is especially important for automated data retrieval and management to **build in** privacy and data protection. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Automated data retrieval and management scale. If done poorly, can **scale privacy infringements**. 

---

# (some) Good practices

**üëç Do**

- Follow your institution's **data protection policies**.

- Clearly **document** all of the data you have, your justification for having it, how you maintain and delete it.

- If you handle personal data, **test** that all of your data pipelines don't "leak" the data before you include personal data in it.

- Regularly **review** what data you have and your reason for  having it.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Don't**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never store** personally identifiable data in non-secure locations

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never transport** personally identifiable data in non-secure ways (e.g. email)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never store** credentials in non-secure locations

# Assumptions behind xkcd framework

JD Long [highlights](https://twitter.com/CMastication/status/1390752830177398785) key assumptions behind this framework that might not hold:

- All time is the same value -&gt; but time right before a deadline might be more valuable than other time

- Automated work is the same quality as non-automated: the process of automation often improves quality (e.g. increases reproducibility)

- The frequency of doing a process stays the same after it is automated: automation makes it easier to do the process again -&gt; you do it more
